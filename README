BLSoundEngine

This is a simple sound engine for iOS games and apps.  It was originally 
created for a game that I've been working on, off and on, for the past 
few years.

You need to make sure you include the AVFoundation.framework for music
playback, and the AudioToolbox.framework for sound effect playback.

There are basic directions in BLSoundEngine.h and a very simple
Xcode 4 example project which shows one way to use it.

This project is MIT Licesned.

The sound samples and music included are Creative Commons BY-SA licensed.

The sound effects were created by me for a project that went defunct in the 
mid 1990s.

Current status:
 - need to create the demo project
 - need to add the sound effects
 - need to move the structures into the demo project, rather than hardcoded
